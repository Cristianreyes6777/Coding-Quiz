## Usage
As soon as you open the link, you will be prompted to "Start Quiz". You then will be prompted to answer 5 questions. When the question is answered correctly you move on to the next question. However, if the question is answered incorrectly, then a deduction of 10 seconds on the timer occurs, and you move on to the next question. If the time runs out, the quiz is over and you will be prompted to submit your initials for grading. Your score out of 5 is displayed at the end and a leaderboard will begin to accure the all scores and then pull them from local storage and show you the top scores.
